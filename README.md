# CIFAR-10 Binary Classification: Can It Fly?

This project demonstrates a binary classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The objective is to classify images into two categories: "can fly" (airplanes and birds) and "cannot fly" (all other classes). The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.
